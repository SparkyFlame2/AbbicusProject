DESCRIPTION:
-------------
ABBICUS.KQB is a word-based math and combat challenge that fuses logic, story, and time-based decision mechanics. Explore relics, unlock secrets, and drift across timelines using a living shell powered by predictive entropy and narrative recursion.

VERSION: 2.9.2

INSTALLING PYTHON (REQUIRED):
----------------------------
Before anything else, install Python 3.10 or higher.

For Windows:
- Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Download the latest 64-bit installer.
- During installation, check **"Add Python to PATH"**, then click Install.

For macOS:
- Use Homebrew: `brew install python`
- Or visit https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

For Linux:
- Most systems already include Python.
- If needed: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`

To test it:
Open a terminal and run:
    python --version
Or:
    py --version

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------------
This project requires the following Python libraries:

• Pillow – used for image rendering
• Pygame – used for sound playback

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES:
----------------------------
For Windows:
1. Open Command Prompt (CMD)
2. Run the following commands:
   py -m pip install pillow
   py -m pip install pygame

For Linux/macOS:
1. Open Terminal
2. Run:
   pip3 install pillow
   pip3 install pygame

For Pydroid 3 (Android):
1. Open Pydroid 3
2. Tap the Pip tab or open the Terminal
3. Run:
   pip install pillow
   pip install pygame

SETUP SHORTCUT:
----------------------------
Use the "Setup- run first!" folder provided in the download package.
This folder contains batch/shell scripts to automatically install dependencies for Windows or Linux/macOS users.

CRITICAL FIRST RUN COMMAND:
----------------------------
Immediately after launch, run:

    scanlore

This command activates the lore indexer and enables key features such as relic classification, drift analysis, and enforcement triggers.

If you do not run `scanlore`, many game systems will appear non-functional.

LAUNCHING THE GAME:
----------------------------
1. Run `Launch_Game.py` to begin the animated title and intro sequence.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts. Once the intro ends, the main shell will launch automatically.
3. You may also launch `main_shell.py` directly to skip the cinematic.

Enjoy your drift through entropy.
